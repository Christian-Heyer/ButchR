# Introduction {#introduction}

**NMF** (**nonnegative matrix factorization**) is a matrix decomposition 
method. A description of the algorithm and it's implementation can be found 
e.g. in [@Lee_article1999]. In 2003, Brunet et al. applied NMF to gene 
expression data [@Brunet_article2003]. In 2010, `r CRANpkg("NMF")`, an R 
package implementing several NMF solvers was published [@Gaujoux_article2010].
NMF basically solves the problem as illustrated in the following figure
(Image taken from 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-negative_matrix_factorization>):

![NMF](NMF.png)

Here, $V$ is an input matrix with dimensions $n \times m$. It is decomposed
into two matrices $W$ of dimension $n \times l$ and $H$ of dimension
$l \times m$, which when multiplied approximate the original matrix $V$. $l$ is
a free parameter in NMF, it is called the factorization rank. If we call the 
columns of $W$ \emph{signatures}, then $l$ corresponds to the number of 
signatures. The decomposition thus leads to a reduction in complexity if 
$l < n$, i.e. if the number of signatures is smaller than the number of 
features, as indicated in the above figure.

In 2015, Mejia-Roa et al. introduced an implementation of an NMF-solver in 
CUDA, which lead to significant reduction of computation times by making use of
massive parallelisation on GPUs [@Mejia_article2015]. Other implementations of
NMF-solvers on GPUs exist.

It is the pupose of the package `ButchR` described here to provide wrapper 
functions in R to these NMF-solvers in TensorFlow. Massive parallelisation not only 
leads to faster algorithms, but also makes the benefits of NMF accessible to 
much bigger matrices. Furthermore, functions for estimation of
the optimal factorization rank and post-hoc feature selection are provided.

# The ButchR package {#ButchR_package}

The matrix decomposition results are stored in an S4 object called 
`nmfExperiment_lite`. `ButchR` provides functions to access the best 
factorzation after $n$ initailization $W$ and $H$ matrices for a given 
factorzation rank.

A crucial step in data analysis with NMF is the determination of the optimal 
factorization rank, i.e. the number of columns of the matrix $W$ or 
equivalently the number of rows of the matrix $H$. No consensus method for an 
automatic evaluation of the optimal factorization rank has been found to date. 
Instead, the decomposition is usually performed iteratively over a range of 
possible factorization ranks and different quality measures are computed for 
every tested factorization ranks. Many quality measures have been proposed:

* The `Frobenius reconstruction error`, i.e. the Frobenius norm of the 
residuals of the decomposition: $||W \cdot H - V||_{F}$
* Criteria to assess the stability of the decomposition:

  + The `cophenetic correlation coefficient`
  + An `Amari type distance`
  + `Silhouette values` over clusters of patterns extracted iteratively at the 
  same factorization rank

The package `ButchR` provides a function to visualize all factorization metrics.

# Example: leukemia data

Preparations


Load the example data

```{r, eval = T}
data(leukemia)
```

Now we are ready to start an NMF analysis.

## NMF analysis

### Call wrapper function

The wrapper function for the NMF solvers in the ButchR package is 
`runNMFtensor_lite`. It is called as follows:

```{r}
k_min <- 2
k_max <- 4

leukemia_nmf_exp <- runNMFtensor_lite(X = leukemia$matrix,
                                      ranks = k_min:k_max,
                                      method = "NMF",
                                      n_initializations = 10, 
                                      extract_features = TRUE)
```

Depending on the choice of parameters (dimensions of the input matrix, number 
of iterations), this step may take some time. Note that the algorithm updates 
the user about the progress in the iterations.

### normalize W matrix  
To make the features in the $W$ matrix comparable, the factorization is 
normalized to make all columns of $W$ sum 1.

```{r}
leukemia_nmf_exp <- normalizeW(leukemia_nmf_exp)
```
 

Several functions to access the results are available:

### `HMatrix` 

Returns the matrix `H` for the optimal decomposition (i.e. the one 
with the minimal residual) for a specific factorization rank `k`. 
The number of rows of the matrix `H` corresponds to the 
chosen factorization rank.

```{r}
leukemia_Hk2 <- HMatrix(leukemia_nmf_exp, k = 2)
class(leukemia_Hk2)
dim(leukemia_Hk2)
kable(leukemia_Hk2[, 1:5])
```

If no value for `k` is supplied, the function returns a list of matrices, 
one for every factorization rank.

```{r}
leukemia_Hlist <- HMatrix(leukemia_nmf_exp)
class(leukemia_Hlist)
length(leukemia_Hlist)
kable(leukemia_Hlist$k2[, 1:5])
```


### `WMatrix`

Returns the matrix `W` for the optimal decomposition (i.e. the one 
with the minimal residual) for a specific factorization rank `k`. 
The number of columns of the matrix `W` corresponds to the 
chosen factorization rank.

```{r}
leukemia_Wk2 <- WMatrix(leukemia_nmf_exp, k = 2)
class(leukemia_Wk2)
dim(leukemia_Wk2)
kable(as.data.frame(leukemia_Wk2[1:5, ]))
```

If no value for `k` is supplied, the function returns a list of matrices, 
one for every factorization rank.

```{r}
leukemia_Wlist <- WMatrix(leukemia_nmf_exp)
class(leukemia_Wlist)
length(leukemia_Wlist)
kable(as.data.frame(leukemia_Wlist$k2[1:5, ]))
```


### `FrobError`

Returns a data frame with as many columns as there are iterated factorization 
ranks and as many rows as there are iterations per factorization rank.

```{r}
kable(FrobError(leukemia_nmf_exp))
```

## Determine the optimal factorization rank

In NMF, Several methods have been described to assess the optimal factorization
rank. The ButchR package implements some of them:  

- *Frobenius error:* The most important information about the many iterated d
ecompositions is the norm of the residual. In NMF this is often called the 
Frobenius error, as the Frobenius norm may be used.  
- *Alexandrov Criterion:* In [@Alex2013] an approach is described in which a 
modified silhouette criterion is used to estimate the stability across iteration 
steps for one fixed factorization rank `k`.  
- *Cophenetic correlation coefficient*  
- *Amari distance*

The values of the computed factorization metrics 
can be accessed with `OptKStats`:


```{r}
kable(OptKStats(leukemia_nmf_exp))
```

These quality measures can be displayed together:

### Generate plots to estimate optimal k

```{r kstats, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
gg_plotKStats(leukemia_nmf_exp)
```


## Visualize the matrix H (exposures)

The matrices `H` may be visualized as heatmaps. We can define a meta
information object and annotate meta data:

```{r}
heat_anno <- HeatmapAnnotation(df = leukemia$annotation[, c("ALL_AML", "Type")],
                               col = list(ALL_AML = c("ALL" = "grey80", 
                                                      "AML" = "grey20"),
                                          Type = c("-" = "white",
                                                   "B-cell" = "grey80",
                                                   "T-cell" = "grey20")))
```

And now display the matrices `H` with meta data annotation:


```{r hheatmap, results='asis'}

for(ki in k_min:k_max) {
  cat("\n")
  cat("  \n#### H matrix for k=",  ki, "   \n  ")
  #plot H matrix
  tmp_hmatrix <- HMatrix(leukemia_nmf_exp, k = ki)
  h_heatmap <- Heatmap(tmp_hmatrix,
                       col = viridis(100),
                       name = "Exposure",
                       clustering_distance_columns = 'pearson',
                       show_column_dend = TRUE,
                       top_annotation = heat_anno,
                       show_column_names = FALSE,
                       show_row_names = FALSE,
                       cluster_rows = FALSE)
  print(h_heatmap)
}


```

## Feature selection 
### Row K-means to determine signature specific features

```{r}
### Find representative regions.
# Get W for best K
leukemia_features <- SignatureSpecificFeatures(leukemia_nmf_exp,
                                               k = 4, 
                                               return_all_features = TRUE)
colnames(leukemia_features) <- paste0("Sign.", 1:4)
kable(head(leukemia_features))

```

### Feature visualization

```{r wspecific}
# List of signature specific features
# leukemia_specific <- SignatureSpecificFeatures(leukemia_nmf_exp,
#                                                k = 4, 
#                                                return_all_features = FALSE)


leukemia_specific <- rownames(leukemia_features)[rowSums(leukemia_features) == 1]
leukemia_Wspecific <- WMatrix(leukemia_nmf_exp, k = 4)[leukemia_specific, ]
colnames(leukemia_Wspecific) <- paste0("Sign.", 1:4)

# normalize exposure score in W matrix across rows
leukemia_Wspecific <- as.data.frame(leukemia_Wspecific) %>% 
  rownames_to_column("GeneID") %>% 
  pivot_longer(-GeneID, names_to = "SignatureID", values_to = "exposure") %>% 
  group_by(GeneID) %>% 
  mutate(exposure = exposure/max(exposure)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(id_cols = GeneID, names_from = "SignatureID", values_from = "exposure") %>% 
  column_to_rownames("GeneID") %>% 
  as.matrix()
  


# Display selected features on W matrix
w_heatmap <- Heatmap(leukemia_Wspecific,
                     col = inferno(100),
                     name = "W matrix",
                     clustering_distance_columns = 'pearson',
                     show_column_dend = TRUE,
                     show_column_names = TRUE,
                     show_row_names = FALSE,
                     cluster_rows = TRUE,
                     cluster_columns = FALSE)
w_heatmap



```

```{r eval=FALSE}
Sys.sleep(60)
```
