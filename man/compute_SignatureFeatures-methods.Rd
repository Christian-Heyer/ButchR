\title{Compute Signature Features
Performs feature extraction for all
factorization ranks > 2.
Returns an nmfExperiment object with computed signature features}
\usage{
compute_SignatureFeatures(x)

\S4method{compute_SignatureFeatures}{nmfExperiment_lite}(x)

\S4method{compute_SignatureFeatures}{integrative_NMF}(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an nmfExperiment, integrative_NMF objects}
}
\value{
the same type of input object with computed signature features.
}
\description{
A K-means with k=2 is run over all rows of the W matrices.
Resulting in a binary matrix for every factorization rank,
with features in the rows and samples in the columns,
in which 1 means that the features is contributing to the signature,
and 0 it does not.
The extraction of Signature Specific Features is not supported for k = 2
